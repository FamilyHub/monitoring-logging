# Logstash Configuration for FamilyHub API Gateway
#
# This configuration file defines how Logstash processes and forwards logs from our API Gateway.
# Logstash acts as a log pipeline that collects, processes, and forwards logs to Elasticsearch.
#
# Use Cases:
# 1. Centralized Logging: Collect logs from all services in one place
# 2. Log Analysis: Enable searching and analyzing logs across services
# 3. Error Tracking: Monitor and alert on error patterns
# 4. Audit Trail: Track all API requests and responses
# 5. Performance Analysis: Analyze request patterns and response times
